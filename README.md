## Installation Instructions and Getting Started
Node.js, MySQL2, Express.js, Sequelize, Bcrypt, and Dotenv all need to be installed. 

Startup Instructions
1) To start the application, navigate in a command console to the "db" folder that houses schema.sql. Enter in 'mysql -u root -p' and enter in your password. This will start up a MySQL instance. Then, enter into console 'source schema.sql', hit enter, and then 'source seeds.sql' and press enter again.

2) Navigate to the folder that houses index.js and enter in 'node index.js'. This will build out tables in the database. Exit of that node session (*ctrl+c* in Windows).

3) Start a new session with 'node seeds/index.js'. This will seed the database with information. Exit of that node session (*ctrl+c* in Windows).

4) Enter in 'node index.js' again. You are now ready to begin.
